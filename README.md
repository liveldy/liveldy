<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>

Hello, I'm AGSN, a crazy tech enthusiast who never knows what they're up to every day, finding bliss in the chaos. I specialize in embedded IoT development and C/C++ software development. If you engage with me, you might find me annoying as I'll try to mock you, although I don't really intend to. If you want to collaborate with me, it would be my honor, after all, who would willingly seek out an arrogant fellow like me?
